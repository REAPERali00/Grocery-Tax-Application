# Grocery Calculator

Have you ever been frustrated by the tax system in the US and Canada, where calculating the final prices of your purchases can feel like navigating through a maze? The challenge doesn't just lie in the fact that taxes are not included in the listed prices, but also in the precise calculation of odd amounts, like $3.97, making it tough to keep a mental tally as you shop.
